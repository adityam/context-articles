The filter module
=================

History
-------

This module started with a simple idea. I wanted an environment
    
    \startmarkdown
    ...
    \stopmarkdown

to write content in Markdown. Such an environment requires a parser that
converts markdown to TeX. A TeX wizard would write such a parser in TeX (which
after all is Turing complete). A lua wizard would write it in LPEG (and wonder
why some users still use MkII). I, being no wizard myself, found an existing
tool that does the job---pandoc. But how could I use pandoc inside ConTeXt?

As for almost everything else in ConTeXt, Hans had already done this; albeit for
a different toll---the R programming language. Based on a user request, the _R
module_ (`m-r.tex`) allows the user to execute snippets of R code. I wanted the
same for Markdown.

I copied the R-module, made a couple of changes, and had a Markdown module
ready. But what if tomorrow I wanted to use ReStructured Text instead of
Markdown? Or Matlab code instead R? Surely, copying the R-module for each
program would be a waste of effort. Each new program requires only a few changes
in the R-module; what I needed was a R-module _template_ so that I could fill in
the blanks with the appropriate values. And so, the filter module was born.
