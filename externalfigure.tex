\StartAbstract
  As the cliché goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. This article provides
  an overview of inserting pictures or images in a \CONTEXT\ document. In contrast to the
  previous article in this series, from now on, I assume that a \CONTEXT\ user
  is using \CONTEXT\ \MKIV: \LUATEX\ engine and \PDF\ output. 
\StopAbstract

\StartArticle

\section {Basic usage}

The simplest way to insert an image is to use:
\startbuffer
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

This command places the \PDF\ image \filename{context-logo.pdf} in a
\type{\vbox}; the width and height of the image are equal to the natural
dimensions of the image.

To set the width of the image to a specific size, say \type{1cm}, use:
\starttyping
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf][width=1cm]
\stoptyping

\noindentation
Similarly, to set the height of the image to a specific size, say \type{2cm}, use:
\starttyping
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf][height=2cm]
\stoptyping

If only the \type{width} or \type{height} of the image is specified, the other
dimension is scaled appropriately to keep the aspect ratio.

To include a specific page, say page 5, of a multi-page \PDF\ file, use:
\starttyping
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf][page=5]
\stoptyping

These four variations cover 90\% of the use cases.

\subsection {Natively supported file formats}

\CONTEXT\ natively supports the image formats enumerated below. The image format
is determined from the file extension (in a case insensitive manner).
% AM: Should we change this to a table?
\startitemize[nowhite]
  \item \cap{PDF}: File extension \filename{.pdf}
  \item \cap{MPS} (Metapost output): File extension \filename{.mps} or
    \filename{.[digit]}.
  \item \cap{JPEG}: File extension \filename{.jpg} or \filename{.jpeg}.
  \item \cap{PNG}: File exetension \filename{.png}
  \item \cap{JPEG 2000}: File extension \filename{.jp2}
  \item \cap{JBIG} or \cap{JBIG2}: File extension \filename{.jbig},
    \filename{.jbig2}, or \filename{.jb2}.
\stopitemize

\subsection {Specifying image directories}

By default, \CONTEXT\ searches a file in the current directory, the parent
directory, the grand-parent directory, and the texmf tree. 

To search for the files in other directories, say \type{images/} subdirectory
and \type{/home/user/images} directory, use:
\startbuffer
\setupexternalfigures
      [directory={images, /home/user/images}]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Note that one should always use forward slashes in path names, {\em even on
Windows}.

% AM: Find out!
% To disable searching of files in the texmf tree, use

\subsection {Include remote images}

Like all other \CONTEXT\ macros that read files, \type{\externalfiguure} also
supports reading remote files from HTTP/HTTPS servers. 

\startbuffer
\externalfigure[http://www.tug.org/images/tuglogo.png]
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer} 

When a document containing a remote file is compiled for the first time, the
remote file is downloaded from the server and stored in the luatex cache
directory. This cached file is used during subsequent runs.

% AM: Should we go into details about how to force redownloading of files?

\section {Transform images}

\subsection {Scale images}

To scale an image use the \type{scale} key: \type{scale=1000} corresponds to the
original dimensions of the image; \type{scale=500} scales the image to
\type{50%} of the original size; \type{scale=1500} scales the images to
\type{150%} of its original size; and so on. For example: 

\startbuffer
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf][scale=500]
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

Use \type{\setupexternalfigures} to set the scale of all images. For example,
to scale all images to be twice their original size, use:
\starttyping
\setupexternalfigures
    [scale=2000]
\stoptyping

In addition, the \type{xscale} and \type{yscale} keys scale the image only in
one dimension. For example:

\startbuffer[x]
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf][xscale=500]
\stopbuffer
%\typebuffer

\startbuffer[y]
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf][yscale=500]
\stopbuffer
%\typebuffer

\midaligned\bgroup
  \setupcombination[distance=3em]
  \startcombination[2]
    {\getbuffer[x]}{\type{xscale=500}}
    {\getbuffer[y]}{\type{yscale=500}}
  \stopcombination
\egroup

If either \type{width} or \type{height} is specified, then the \type{scale} key
has no affect. 

\subsection {Specify maximum size of an image}

\subsection {Rotate images}

To rotate the included image by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, use the
\type{orientation} key. For example:
\startbuffer
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf][orientation=90]
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

To rotate by an arbitrary angle, use the \type{\rotate} command. For example:
% AM: Interesting anti-aliasing at 100% zoom on evince.
% Goes away at 300% zoom.
\startbuffer
\rotate[rotation=45]{\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf]}
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

% TODO: Add reference to the wiki page on rotate

\subsection {Mirror images}

The \type{\externalfigure} macro does not provide any support for flipping
images. Use the generic \type{\mirror} command to mirror images. For example, to
mirror horizontally use:
\startbuffer
\mirror{\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf]}
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

\noindentation and to mirror vertically, first rotate the image by 180° and then
mirror it:
\startbuffer
\mirror{\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf]
                       [orientation=180]}
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

% TODO: Add reference to the wiki page on mirror

\subsection {Clip images}

The \type{\externalfigure} macro does not provide any support for clipping
images. Use the generic \type{\clip} command to clip images. 

For example, to clip the original image to a \type{1cm x 2cm}
rectangle at an offset of \type{(3mm, 5mm)} from the top left corner, use:
\startbuffer
\clip[width=1cm, height=2cm, hoffset=3mm, voffset=5mm]
     {\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf]}
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

As another example, to cut the image into a \type{3x3} pieces and include the
\type{(2,2)} piece, use:
\startbuffer
\clip[nx=3,ny=3,x=2,y=2]
     {\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf]}
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

% TODO: Add details to the wiki page on clip and refer to that.

\section {Troubleshooting}

\subsection {Visualize the bounding box of the image}

In some situation, e.g., if the image is taking more space than expected, it is
useful to visualize the bounding box of the image. To do so, use:
\startbuffer
\externalfigure[context-logo.pdf][frame=on]
\stopbuffer
\typebuffer

\midaligned{\getbuffer}

\CONTEXT\ includes a Perl script \type{pdftrimwhite} that may be used to
remove extra white space around a \PDF\ file. To run this script, type:
\startlines\switchtobodyfont[small]\tt
mtxrun --script pdftrimwhite {\it [flags]} {\it input} {\it output}
\stoplines

\noindentation

The most important flag is \type{--offset=<dimen>} that keeps some extra
space around the trimmed image.

A similar functionality is provided by another Perl script \type{pdfcrop} that
is part of most \TEX\ distributions.
