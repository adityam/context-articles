\StartAbstract
  As the clich√© goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. In this article, I
  explain how to add a picture to a \CONTEXT\ document. To keep things simple,
  I'll only explain how things work with \CONTEXT\ MkIV: LuaTeX engine and PDF
  output. Most of the usage remains the same for other engines---PDFTeX and
  XeTeX. but tracing and automatic conversion does not work---and for other
  output formats---DVI, but not all image formats are supported.
