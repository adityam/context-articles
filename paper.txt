The basics

Paper size
----------

Plain \TEX{} and \LATEX{} were primarily developed in the US. So, they default to
letter paper, which is the standard paper size in the US. \CONTEXT{} was developed
in the Netherlands. So, it defaults to A4 paper, which is the
standard paper size in Europe (and almost everywhere else in the world).

Changing paper size is easy. To get letter paper, use[^syntax]:

    \setuppapersize[letter]

Similarly, to get A4 paper, use:

    \setuppapersize[A4]

[^syntax]: The syntax used here only works with ConTeXt versions newer than
February 2011. In earlier versions, you had to use

        \setuppapersize[letter][letter]

    to get letter sized paper. You may wonder why we need to repeat the paper size
    twice. In most cases, these are the same. You only need to use different
    arguments if you want to print on a bigger paper and trim it later (see
    the section on print size for details).

Both `A4` and `letter` are predefined paper sizes. \CONTEXT{} also predefines
many commonly used paper sizes. These include:

- `letter`, `ledger`, `tabloid`, `legal`, `folio`, and `executive` sizes from
  the North American paper standard;

- sizes `A0` -- `A10`, `B0` -- `B10`, and `C0` -- `C10` from the A, B, and C
  series of the ISO-216 standard; 

- sizes `RA0` -- `RA4` and `SRA0` -- `SRA4` from the RA and SRA series of
  ISO-217 paper standard;

- sizes `C6/C5`, `DL`, and `E4` from ISO-269 standard envelope sizes;

- `envelope 9` -- `envelope 14` sizes from the American postal standard;

- sizes `G5` and `E5` from the Swedish SIS-014711 standard. These are used for
  Swedish theses; 

- size `CD` for CD covers;

- size `S3` -- `S6`, `S8`, `SM`, and `SW` for screen sizes. These sizes are
  useful for presentations. `S3` -- `S6` and `S8` have an aspect ratio of
  $4\colon 3$. `S3` is 300pt wide, `S4` is 400pt wide, and so on. `S6` is almost
  as wide as a `A4` paper. `SM` and `SW` are for medium and wide screens; they
  have the same height as `S6`;

- a few more paper sizes, which I will not mention here. See
  `page-lay.mki(i|v)` for details.

Definition new paper sizes
---------------------------

The predefined paper sizes in \CONTEXT{} cannot fit all needs. To define a new
paper size, use 

    \definepapersize[exotic]
                    [width=50mm, height=100mm]

This defines a paper size called _exotic_ that is 50mm wide and 100mm high.
Instead of _exotic_, any other word could have been used as a name. This new
paper size can now be used as any of the predefined paper sizes (In fact, all
predefined paper sizes are defined using `\definepapersize`). Thus, to set the
paper size to 50mm x 100mm paper, use

    \setuppapersize[exotic]

Orientation and rotation
------------------------

Most of the popular paper sizes default to a potrait orientation. To get
landscape orientation, use

    \setuppapersize[letter,landscape]

To rotate the paper by 90 degrees, use

    \setuppapersize[letter,rotated]

To rotate the paper by other multiples of 90 degrees, use

    \setuppapersize[letter,90]
    \setuppapersize[letter,180]
    \setuppapersize[letter,270]
