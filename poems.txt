Basic setup
============

\CONTEXT{} does not have a dedicated environment for typesetting poems. But, it
is easy to piggyback on the `lines` environment to typeset poems. I'll use the
first four stanzas from Inferno, which is the first part Dante's poem Divine Comedy.

\startbuffer[inferno]
Midway upon the journey of our life 
I found myself within a forest dark, 
For the straightforward pathway had been lost. 
     
Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say 
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern, 
Which in the very thought renews the fear. 

So bitter is it, death is little more; 
But of the good to treat, which there I found, 
Speak will I of the other things I saw there.

I cannot well repeat how there I entered, 
So full was I of slumber at the moment 
In which I had abandoned the true way. 
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer[inferno]

The simplest way to typeset a poem is using the `lines` environment.

    \startlines
    ....
    \stoplines

which gives

\startlines
\getbuffer[inferno]
\stoplines
